Welcome to **Code With Behnam**, a notebook of hard-earned lessons from building analytics platforms, shipping ML systems, and coaching teams through the tooling hype-cycle. The blog used to feel like a single-track diary; now it acts as a living guidebook for anyone navigating AI + data work end to end.

Whether you're wrangling SQL, instrumenting LLM guardrails, or debugging dashboards five minutes before a board review, you'll find practical walkthroughs, failure post-mortems, and ready-to-steal snippets here.
