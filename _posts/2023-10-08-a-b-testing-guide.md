A/B testing is a fundamental methodology for making data-driven decisions. This guide covers everything you need to know about designing and analyzing A/B tests.

## What is A/B Testing?

A/B testing is a randomized experiment where two or more variants are compared to determine which performs better on a specific metric.

## When to Use A/B Testing

- Website optimization
- Product feature changes
- Marketing campaigns
- User interface improvements

## Key Concepts

### Hypothesis Formation
- Null hypothesis (H0)
- Alternative hypothesis (H1)

### Sample Size Calculation
Determine the number of observations needed for statistical significance.

### Statistical Significance
Typically set at 95% confidence level (p-value < 0.05).

### Statistical Power
Usually aim for 80% power to detect meaningful differences.

## Common Metrics

- Conversion rate
- Click-through rate (CTR)
- Average order value
- User engagement

## Pitfalls to Avoid

1. Stopping tests too early
2. Testing too many variants
3. Not accounting for seasonality
4. Selection bias
5. Ignoring the novelty effect

## Analysis Techniques

- T-tests for continuous metrics
- Chi-square tests for categorical metrics
- Bayesian approaches for more nuanced results

## Conclusion

Proper A/B testing enables organizations to make evidence-based decisions and continuously improve their products and services.
