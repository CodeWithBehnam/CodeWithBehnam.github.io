Neural networks are the backbone of modern deep learning. This article provides an introduction to how neural networks work and their applications.

## What are Neural Networks?

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks in animal brains. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers.

## Architecture Components

### Input Layer
Receives the initial data for processing.

### Hidden Layers
Perform computations and feature extraction. Deep networks have multiple hidden layers.

### Output Layer
Produces the final prediction or classification.

## Activation Functions

- ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
- Sigmoid
- Tanh
- Softmax

## Training Process

1. Forward propagation
2. Loss calculation
3. Backpropagation
4. Weight updates

## Applications

- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Speech recognition
- Game playing

## Conclusion

Neural networks have revolutionized AI and continue to drive innovations across various domains.
