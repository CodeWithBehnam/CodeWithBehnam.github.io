Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. In this article, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of machine learning and its various types.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled training data and makes predictions based on that data.

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning algorithms work with unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns or structures.

### Reinforcement Learning
This type involves learning through interaction with an environment to maximize rewards.

## Conclusion

Understanding these fundamental concepts is crucial for anyone starting their journey in machine learning and data science.
